# AEO Draft Lab — feature specs

The current, authoritative description of what the app does. This is the
target of the feedback workflow: items resolved from `FEEDBACK.md` get their
resulting behavior folded in here, so the spec always matches what's
actually built (not what was originally planned).

**Pending import**: a prior Claude Cowork session specced out additional
features not yet reflected here — the user will bring those notes over from
another device and they need to be merged in. Until then, treat this doc as
incomplete, not final.

## App shape

Single-page app (`public/index.html`), five tabs:

### Draft Room
Live mock draft UI — best-available player pool, "on the clock" indicator,
my picks & projected availability, my roster, and a full snake draft board
(dashed cells = keepers; clicking a team header on the board lets you set
who's on the clock manually).

### Teams & Keepers
Rival roster view and keeper assignment/modeling across the league.

### Mocks
Cloud-saved mock draft history (KV-backed via `/api/mocks`), synced across
devices. Save the current draft, list saved mocks newest-first, load or
delete one. Falls back to local-only ("Save config" in the Data tab) when
the cloud API isn't reachable.

### Strategy Lab
Compares draft paths/strategies side by side (`renderStratCards`).

### Data
Player pool view (ADP/ECR/projection) and keeper list, plus config
export/import (JSON) as an offline backup independent of the cloud Mocks
feature.

## Draft order

Fixed by the `OWNER_SLOT` constant in `public/index.html`, e.g.:

```js
const OWNER_SLOT={Robert:1,Edward:2,Haiko:3,Aren:4,Taron:5,Dirty:7,Hovo:6,Savada:8,Jiro:9,Mher:10,Shant:11,Sako:12};
```

Not editable from the UI today — changing it means editing source and
redeploying. Open request to make this editable in-app: see `FEEDBACK.md`.

## Target feature set (Draft Wizard baseline)

FantasyPros' **Draft Wizard** is the agreed working baseline for where this
app is headed — the look, feel, and capability bar. This is not a clone: it
stays custom to this 12-team keeper league (real owner names, real rosters,
our keeper rules). Researched 2026-08-20; individual items are tracked as 🆕
entries in `FEEDBACK.md`.

### What Draft Wizard does, and where we stand

| Draft Wizard capability | What it does | Our status |
|---|---|---|
| **Mock Draft Simulator** | Fast mocks vs simulated opponents, no waiting between picks | ✅ Have it — Draft Room |
| **Keeper support** | Enter keepers per team with the round each costs; mocks account for them | ✅ Have it, and ours is more specific (real rosters + locked keepers) |
| **Opponent pick logic** | Weighs rankings + team needs + positional scarcity; Basic vs Advanced modes | ⚠️ Partial — ours picks randomly within an ADP noise window; no roster-need or scarcity awareness |
| **Draft Intel** | Analyzes leaguemates' past drafts for tendencies; toggle per team into mocks | ❌ Missing — but high value here since it's the same 12 owners yearly |
| **Player queue** | Shortlist of targets, surfaced when you're on the clock | ❌ Missing |
| **Tiers** | Tier breaks in rankings + "players left in tier" counter that reddens | ❌ Missing (CSV already carries a `tier` column, unused) |
| **Draft Analyzer** | Post-draft grade, projected standings, positional ranks, strengths/weaknesses, steals & reaches | ❌ Missing |
| **Redo / restart from any pick** | Branch a mock from an earlier point to test alternatives | ⚠️ Partial — single-step `undo()` only |
| **Cheat Sheet Creator** | Import/blend rankings from any source, drag-drop reorder, custom tiers | ⚠️ Partial — Data tab imports a CSV; no reordering or blending UI |
| **Strategy comparison** | — (not a distinct DW tool) | ✅ Ours already exceeds this — Strategy Lab compares draft paths over N sims |

### Design direction

Draft Wizard's during-draft screen is dense and information-forward: best
available on the left with per-player value context, your roster and needs
alongside, the board underneath, and always-visible "what should I do right
now" guidance. Our Draft Room is already shaped this way — the gap is mostly
in the *decision support* (tiers, queue, scarcity/run signals, need-aware
opponents) and the *after-action review* (grade, steals/reaches, projected
finish), not in the overall layout.

### Deliberately out of scope

- Live-draft sync with Yahoo/ESPN/Sleeper (Draft Assistant's real-time
  tracking) — this league doesn't draft on a synced platform.
- Salary-cap/auction and dynasty/rookie modes — the auction and superflex
  leagues are a separate roadmap item (multi-league selector), not part of
  matching Draft Wizard here.
- Accounts, subscriptions, tiers of access — personal tool.

## Deployment

See `CLAUDE.md` for the Worker/KV architecture — not a feature spec concern,
kept there to avoid duplication.
